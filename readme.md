# Flight Delay Simulation

## Setup

This code has been tested on python 3.5.2 and pytorch 1.3.0. Also make sure you have proper installations of matplotlib and tensorboard.

To run the code, make sure you download the data file [flights.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv) from the Kaggle website, and place the file into the ./datasets folder
